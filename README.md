# blogger-template
This repository contains the code for my blogger template. This is a simple template based on bootstrap. The landing page for the blog shows summary of the posts with a dynamically inserted "Read more" link. 

The structure is as follows:
- template.xml - This is the actual template. Upload to Blogger to apply to your site.
- js - this folder contains the javascript needed by the template. You will need to host these somewhere and update the references in the template.xml
- css - contains the css files for bootstrap. You will need to host these somewhere and update the references in the template.xml
